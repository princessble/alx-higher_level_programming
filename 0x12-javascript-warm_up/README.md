## Instructions

### First constant, first print

**File:** 0-javascript_is_amazing.js

- Print "JavaScript is amazing" to the console.
- Use a constant variable called `myVar` with the value "JavaScript is amazing".
- Use `console.log(...)` to print the output.

### 3 languages

**File:** 1-multi_languages.js

- Print three lines to the console:
  1. "C is fun"
  2. "Python is cool"
  3. "JavaScript is amazing"
- Use `console.log(...)` for each line.

### Arguments

**File:** 2-arguments.js

- Print a message depending on the number of arguments passed:
  - If no arguments are passed, print "No argument".
  - If only one argument is passed, print "Argument found".
  - Otherwise, print "Arguments found".
- Use `console.log(...)` to print the output.
- Reference: `process.argv`

### Value of my argument

**File:** 3-value_argument.js

- Print the first argument passed to the script:
  - If no arguments are passed, print "No argument".
- Use `console.log(...)` to print the output.
- You are not allowed to use `var`.
- You are not allowed to use `length`.

### Create a sentence

**File:** 4-concat.js

- Print two arguments passed to it in the format " is ".
- Use `console.log(...)` to print the output.

### An Integer

**File:** 5-to_integer.js

- Print "My number: <first argument converted to an integer>" if the first argument can be converted to an integer.
- If the argument can't be converted to an integer, print "Not a number".
- Use `console.log(...)` to print the output.
- You are not allowed to use `var`.
- You are not allowed to use try/catch.

### Loop to languages

**File:** 6-multi_languages_loop.js

- Print three lines using an array of strings and a loop:
  1. "C is fun"
  2. "Python is cool"
  3. "JavaScript is amazing"
- Use only one `console.log(...)`.
- Use a loop (while, for, etc.).
- You are not allowed to use any if/else statement.

### I love C

**File:** 7-multi_c.js

- Print "C is fun" x times, where x is the first argument of the script.
- If the first argument can't be converted to an integer, print "Missing number of occurrences".
- Use a loop (while, for, etc.) and only two `console.log(...)` statements.

### Square

**File:** 8-square.js

- Print a square of a given size using the character "X".
- The size is the first argument.
- If the first argument can't be converted to an integer, print "Missing size".
- Use `console.log(...)` to print the output.
- Use a loop (while, for, etc.).

### Add

**File:** 9-add.js

- Create a function `add(a, b)` that returns the addition of two integers.
- You must use `console.log(...)` to print the output.
- You are not allowed to use `var`.

### Factorial

**File:** 10-factorial.js

- Compute and print the factorial of a given integer.
- The integer is the first argument.
- If the argument is not an integer, print "Factorial of NaN is 1".
- You must do it recursively and use a function.
- Use `console.log(...)` to print the output.
- You are not allowed to use `var`.

### Second biggest!

**File:** 11-second_biggest.js
