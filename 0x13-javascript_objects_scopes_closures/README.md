## Task 0: Rectangle #0 🧱

Write an empty class `Rectangle` that defines a rectangle:

- You must use the class notation for defining your class.

## Task 1: Rectangle #1 📐

Write a class `Rectangle` that defines a rectangle:

- You must use the class notation for defining your class.
- The constructor must take 2 arguments `w` and `h`.
- Initialize the instance attribute `width` with the value of `w`.
- Initialize the instance attribute `height` with the value of `h`.

## Task 2: Rectangle #2 📏

Write a class `Rectangle` that defines a rectangle:

- You must use the class notation for defining your class.
- The constructor must take 2 arguments `w` and `h`.
- Initialize the instance attribute `width` with the value of `w`.
- Initialize the instance attribute `height` with the value of `h`.
- If `w` or `h` is equal to 0 or not a positive integer, create an empty object.

## Task 3: Rectangle #3 🖨️

Write a class `Rectangle` that defines a rectangle:

- You must use the class notation for defining your class.
- The constructor must take 2 arguments: `w` and `h`.
- Initialize the instance attribute `width` with the value of `w`.
- Initialize the instance attribute `height` with the value of `h`.
- If `w` or `h` is equal to 0 or not a positive integer, create an empty object.
- Create an instance method called `print()` that prints the rectangle using the character `X`.

## Task 4: Rectangle #4 🔄

Write a class `Rectangle` that defines a rectangle:

- You must use the class notation for defining your class.
- The constructor must take 2 arguments: `w` and `h`.
- Initialize the instance attribute `width` with the value of `w`.
- Initialize the instance attribute `height` with the value of `h`.
- If `w` or `h` is equal to 0 or not a positive integer, create an empty object.
- Create an instance method called `print()` that prints the rectangle using the character `X`.
- Create an instance method called `rotate()` that exchanges the width and the height of the rectangle.
- Create an instance method called `double()` that multiplies the width and the height of the rectangle by 2.

## Task 5: Square #0 ◻️

Write a class `Square` that defines a square and inherits from `Rectangle`:

- You must use the class notation for defining your class and `extends`.
- The constructor must take 1 argument: `size`.
- The constructor of `Rectangle` must be called (by using `super()`).

## Task 6: Square #1 🔲

Write a class `Square` that defines a square and inherits from `Square` of 5-square.js:

- You must use the class notation for defining your class and `extends`.
- Create an instance method called `charPrint(c)` that prints the rectangle using the character `c`.
- If `c` is undefined, use the character `X`.

## Task 7: Occurrences 🔍

Write a function that returns the number of occurrences in a list:

- Prototype: `exports.nbOccurences = function (list, searchElement)`.

## Task 8: Esrever ↩️

Write a function that returns the reversed version of a list:

- Prototype: `exports.esrever = function (list)`.
- You are not allowed to use the built-in method `reverse`.

## Task 9: Log me 📢

Write a function that prints the number of arguments already printed and the new argument value:

- Prototype: `exports.logMe = function (item)`.
- Output format: `<number arguments already printed>: <current argument value>`.

## Task 10: Number conversion 🔢

Write a function that converts a number from base 10 to another base passed as an argument:

- Prototype: `exports.converter = function (base)`.
- You are not allowed to import any file.
- You are not allowed to declare any new variable (`var`, `let`, etc.).
